# On a serious note:
### I am a Full Stack Developer, who loves to code, and I am always looking for new challenges and this was my attempt to make a story driven portfolio, with a interactive timeline, where you can explore the story of the legend.

### For anyone who didnt completely get the context of it:
#### It is my story, TARS is the narrator, I am a student at NSUT. The ancient powers of the gods are my Skills, and the villains are the projects I have made. Army refers to the companies and experience I have gained throughout my journey. And the holy trinity is the Linkedin, Github and Leetcode.

### I am open to any suggestions, and I will be happy to hear from you.
